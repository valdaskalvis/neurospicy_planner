Hello!
This is work in an early stage still, far from suitable for daily use yet.

This is a task scheduling app aimed to help neurodivergent people
overcome their shortcomings with using a planner. Usually neurodivergent
people get excited to use a new planner only to get overwhelmed by the
tasks mounting after forgetting to use it for a day or two. Past due tasks
also contribute to mounting issues, and most of the time a planner gets
dropped. Our aim is to help prevent the terrifying mounting of tasks and
assist in managing daily life in a comfortable, healthy and sustainable way.

What you get with this app:
- clear distinction between personal and work tasks;
- easily available shopping list;
- gamification (TBD)
- automatic rescheduling of tasks that were not completed today (TBD);
- automatic rescheduling of regular tasks at set intervals (daily/weekly/etc);
- assistance with rescheduling tasks when there's just too much (TBD);
- motivational quotes for inspiration (TBD);
- reminders about tasks far away - and those forgotten (TBD);
- various settings to customize your app (TBD);
- all kinds of fun stats to inspire and motivate (TBD);
- OpenDyslexic font is chosen to make reading easy while adding some
whimsy at the same time. You can read about its advantages and find other
